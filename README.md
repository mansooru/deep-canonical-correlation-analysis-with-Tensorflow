Developing deep learning based CCA algorithm with imaging genetics application
# In this study aimed to discover novel genetic variants using DL based imaging genetics 
Breifly, 
1) I'm trying to develop DL based CCA algorithm with tensorflow.
2) I want to applying GraphNet regulaizer, which is robust in imaging genetics with CCA

There are some challenges in this study
1) imaging genetics with CCA is unsupervised learning methology 
2) Not enough samples were avaliable, need some idea to overcome
3) No reference algorithm is avaliable

1) Motivated by cycleGAN and deep feature selection, i developed circular feature selection network 
2) Submitted in MICCAI 2019
