# Proj.title: deep-canonical-correlation-analysis-with-Tensorflow
# Developing deep learning based CCA algorithm with imaging genetics application
#
# In this study aimed to discover novel genetic variants using DL based imaging genetics 
# Breifly, 
# 1) I'm trying to develop DL based CCA algorithm with tensorflow.
# 2) I want to applying GraphNet regulaizer, which is robust in imaging genetics with CCA
# 
# There are some challenges in this study
# 1) imaging genetics with CCA is unsupervised learning methology 
# 2) Not enought samples were avaliable, need some idea to overcome
# 3) No reference algorithm is avaliable
